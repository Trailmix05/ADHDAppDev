# ADHDAppDev
Hello! I am Trailmix05, and here is my first app developped solo.

Here is a brief description:
- Task manager with a merit/reward system.
Person/User has a list of tasks that they have to do (meanial to exceptionnal). For an ADHD person (or even general public) they have varying difficulties for the different tasks. Doing a harder task will allow the person to get more points then if they did easier tasks. These points have a reward system where the Person/User can allow themselves to get 50â‚¬ Amazon cart (just an example), or do a small roadtrip or something else. It should release the "feel good about myself since i don't feel like a complete shit" chemicals

The Person/User sets the difficilty of the task, how many tasks are needed, and the different milestones. This is a work in progress, so I ask you to bear with me while I try to get this done. I am a SoloDev doing this with limited knowledge, a student, and I possibly have a part-time job while creating the app
